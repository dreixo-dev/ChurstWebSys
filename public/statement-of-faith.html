                    <h4>The Holy Scriptures</h4>
                    <p>We believe that the Bible, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired Word of God, inerrant in the original manuscripts, and the final authority in all matters of faith and practice.</p>
                    <div class="scripture-reference">
